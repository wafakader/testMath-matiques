Exercice 1 : 

  Let I = {1, 2, . . . , 100}
  X and Y are chosen independently and uniformly
  For every element a of I, we have these possible options: 
    a∈X		a∈Y
    a∈X		a∉ Y              Each option have the probability p=1/4
    a∉ X		a∈Y
    a∉ X		a∉ Y

  To have X a subset of Y, 3 options have to be true for every element a of I 
    a∈X		a∈Y
    a∉ X		a∈Y
    a∉ X		a∉ Y
    
  So the probability P=3/4 for each element of I
  
  For the whole set (I), the probability is equal to P=〖(3/4)〗^100

Exercice 2 :  

  n ∈ N, F(n)=2F(√n)+1
  Let the function g(n)=F(n)+1 so we have g(n)-1=2g(√n)-2+1
  Then we have g(n)=2g(√(n))
  This function g is satisfied by the function ln 
    So g(n)=ln⁡(n) which leads to F(n)=ln⁡(n)-1
